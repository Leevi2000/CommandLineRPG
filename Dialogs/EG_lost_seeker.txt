	[TXT]
	{NPC}: I once was just like you, an adventurer without a destination.
	       Too bad my greed won over as I tried to obtain the Heart of the Mistspire

	[TXT]
	{NPC}: I warn you about the Giant Mistspire Tree. I recommend avoiding that place at all cost.
	       Wanting to explore that place would need many men.
		
	       Other than that, the things around here are fairly peaceful.
